## WARNING: This version is **DEPRECATED**. Find a newer one at my discord: https://discord.gg/cJSh8ksxp6 where I post other Steam tools. If that doesn't work, CONTACT ME VIA DISCORD: 𝙨𝙬𝙤𝙤𝙨𝙝#1673

WARNING: SAC v2 is being worked on! Join my discord above to receive new updates.



# steam-account-checker v1
🔥 Check your Steam accounts to see if they are created and SteamGuard protected within seconds

#### Download it here: https://github.com/swooshXE/steam-account-checker/releases
## Development
This version of SAC will most likely not be updated as I'm working on a V2. I'm developing my own set of tools (sxetools) and SAC V2 will be part of it. Join my discord server for more info at the beggining of this post.

## What can you do:

### Automatic check

...
```
- Hit 'Check for accounts'

### Status messages:

- **«nothing»** - Successfully connected to account
- **SteamGuard protected** - The account EXISTS but in order to log in, you must verify it with its associated e-mail address
- **InvalidPassword** - The account doesn't exist (or mispelled something)
- **RateLimitExceeded** - You've checked too many accounts in a short period of time - Adding proxys in V2
- **ServiceUnavailable** - Couldn't connect to Steam servers (it's probably down)
